## Contents of the package

This python package contains the class definition and functions used in the analysis of the data from the Bee-path experiment.
It may be used to analyze point-like GPS general mobility data and to aggregate such points into displacements and paused states.
For more details check out the webpage of the project  [Bee-path](http://bee-path.net/?lang=en) and the related publications.

The module is fully documented in a *quasi-standard*, *pythonic* way (but could be improved).
