Scientiffic soft

This repo contains the scienttific modules used for the bee-path experiments.
All the codes are written in standard python, using the following modules:

Numpy
Scipy
Pyproj
simplekml
geopy

The module is fully documented (but could be improved).

The info about what the functions do is on the info_soft.pdf file (in Catalan)

To Do:

Need to adapt the custom classes using __getattr__ rather than the existing methods.
